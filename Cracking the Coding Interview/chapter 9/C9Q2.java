Problem:
	Imagine a robot sitting on the upper left comer of an X by Ygrid. The robot 
can only move in two directions: right and down. How many possible paths are there 
for the robot to go from (0, 0) to (X, Y) ?

FOLLOW UP:
	Imagine certain spots are "off limits," such that the robot cannot step on them. 
Design an algorithm to find a path for the robot from the top left to the bottom 
right.

Solution:
	Earlier, we'd mentioned an issue with duplicate paths. To find a path 
to (X,Y), we look for a path to an adjacent coordinate: (X-1,Y) or (X, Y -l). 
Of course, if one of those squares is off limits, we ignore it. Then, we 
look at their adjacentcoordinates: (X-2,Y), (X-ljY-1), (X-ljY-l^and (X,Y-2).
The spot (X-1,Y-1) appears twice, which means that we're duplicating effort. 
Ideally, we should remember that we already visited (X-l^Y-l) sothat we don't
waste our time.
	This is what the dynamic programming algorithm below does.
