Problem:

    You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node 
contains a single digit.The digits are stored in reverse order, such that 
the 1's digit (largest digit) is at the head of the list. Write a function 
that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.

	

Solution:

   It's useful to remember in this problem how exactly addition works. 
   
   Imagine the problem:
   617 + 295
   7->1->6 + 5->9->2

   1234 + 567
   4->3->2->1 + 7->6->5

   First, we add 7 and 5 to get 12. The digit 2 becomes the last digit of the number, 
and 1 gets carried over to the next step. Second, we add 1, 1, and 9 to get 11 .
The 1 becomes the second digit, and the other 1 gets carried over the final step. 
Third and finally, we add 1,6 and 2 to get 9. So,our value becomes 912.

   We can mimic this process recursively by adding node by node, carrying over any 
"excess" data to the next node. Let's walk through this for the below linked list:
   7->1->6 + 5->9->2
   
   We do the following:

1. We add 7 and 5 first, getting a result of 12. 2 becomes the first node in our 
linkedlist, and we "carry" the 1 to the next sum. 
   List: 2-> ?

2. We then add 1 and 9, as well as the "carry", getting a result of 11. 1 becomes 
the second element of our linkedlist,and we carry the 1 to the next sum.
   List: 2->1-> ?

3. Finally, we add 6, 2 and our "carry," to get 9. This become the final element of 
our linked list.
   List: 2->1->9.

public LinkedListNode addLists(LinkedListNode l1, LinkedListNode l2, int carryon){
	/* We're done if both lists are null and the carry value is 0 */
	if(l1 == null && l2 == null & carryon == 0)
		return null;

	LinkedListNode result = new LinkedListNode(carryon);
	// Add value, and the data from 11 and 12
	int value = carryon;
	if(l1 != null){
		value += l1.data;
	}
	if(l2 != null){
		value += l2.data;
	}
	// Second digit of numbe
	result.data = value % 10;
	// Recurse
	if(l1 != null || l2 != null){
		LinkedListNode more = addLists(l1 == null ? null : l1.next,
									   l2 == null ? null : l2.next,
									   value >= 10 ? 1 : 0);
		result.next = more;	
	}
	return result;
}

FOLLOW UP

	Suppose the digits are stored in forward order. Repeat the above 
problem.



Solution:
   Part B is conceptually the same (recurse, carry the excess), but has 
some additional complications when it comes to implementation:
  
   1234 + 567
   1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 and 5 -> 6 -> 7

1. One list may be shorter than the other, and we cannot handle this 
"on the fly." For example, suppose we were adding (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4) and 
(5 -> 6 -> 7). We need to know that the 5 should be "matched" with the 2, 
not the 1. We can accomplish this by comparing the lengths of the lists 
in the beginning and padding the shorter list with zeros.

2. In the first part, successive results were added to the tail (i.e.,
passed forward). This meant that the recursive call would be passed the 
carry, and would return the result (which is then appended to the tail). 
In this case, however, results are added to the head (i.e., passed 
backward). The recursive call must return the result, as before, as 
well as the carry. This is not terribly challenging to implement,but it 
is more cumbersome. We can solve this issue by creating a wrapper class 
called Partial Sum.
