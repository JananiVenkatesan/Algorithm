Introduction (Beginner)
	
	What is a dynamic programming, how can it be described? 

    A DP is an algorithmic technique which is usually based on a recurrent formula and one (or some) starting states. A sub-solution of the problem is constructed from previously found ones. DP solutions have a polynomial complexity which assures a much faster running time than other techniques like backtracking, brute-force etc. 

	Now let's see the base of DP with the help of an example: 

	Given a list of N coins, their values (V1, V2, ... , VN), and the total sum S. Find the minimum number of coins the sum of which is S (we can use as many coins of one type as we want), or report that it's not possible to select coins in such a way that they sum up to S. 

	Now let's start constructing a DP solution: 

	First of all we need to find a state for which an optimal solution is found and with the help of which we can find the optimal solution for the next state.
